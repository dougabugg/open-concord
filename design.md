# Design
Here is what I am planning for the first release. A server application (minimal GUI, mostly head-less), and a client application (cross platform, mostly GUI, modular). The server application can be run on multiple trusted devices, and be configured to federate together into a distributed ad-hoc network providing backend services for client applications that are invited and permitted to participated in the network. A user can own multiple devices, and have the same identity synchronized across each device with the help of the servers. Private messages between users and clients would have the option for being truly end-to-end encrypted between the parties, for privacy, and open group chats visible to all members of the server would also be available.
