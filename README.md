# open-concord
an open source clone of the popular software-as-a-service project known as "discord"

I like using discord. It's a neat little project, and I've even made some new friends using it! (hi @lthon09 :P !) However, I remember seeing on twitter some users complaining about how discord had shutdown 3rd party client projects, or possibly even banned specific user accounts, for connecting with a 3rd party client. I think that's kind of shitty. If Discord is ever bought out by Microsoft and goes to shit, I would really like to have an alternative group chat platform with support for sharing files, videos, screens, events, etc, that is entirely open source and controlled by the community. That's basically what this project is!
